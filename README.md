Sparkling Water integrates H<sub>2</sub>O's fast scalable machine learning engine with Spark.

<a name="Req"></a>
## Requirements

  * Linux or OS X (Windows support is pending)
  * Java 7
  * [Spark 1.2.0](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
    * `SPARK_HOME` shell variable must point to your local Spark installation

<a name="MakeBuild"></a>
## Making a build

Use the provided `gradlew` to build project:

```
./gradlew build
```

> To avoid running tests, please, use `-x test` option

---
<a name="SparkShell"></a>
## Sparkling shell

The Sparkling shell provides a regular Spark shell that supports creation of an H<sub>2</sub>O cloud and execution of H<sub>2</sub>O algorithms.

First, build a package containing Sparkling water:
```
./gradlew assemble
```

Configure the location of Spark cluster:
```
export SPARK_HOME="/path/to/spark/installation"
export MASTER="local-cluster[3,2,1024]"
```

> In this case `local-cluster[3,2,1024]` points to embedded cluster of 3 worker nodes, each with 2 cores and 1G of memory.

And run Sparkling Shell:
```
bin/sparkling-shell
```

> Sparkling Shell accepts common Spark Shell arguments. For example, to increase memory allocated by each executor use the `spark.executor.memory` parameter: `bin/sparkling-shell --conf "spark.executor.memory=4g"`

<a name="RunExample"></a>
## Running examples

Build a package that can be submitted to Spark cluster:
```
./gradlew assemble
```

Set the configuration of the demo Spark cluster, for example; `local-cluster[3,2,1024]`

```
export SPARK_HOME="/path/to/spark/installation"
export MASTER="local-cluster[3,2,1024]"
```
> In this example, the description `local-cluster[3,2,1024]` causes the creation of an embedded cluster consisting of 3 workers.

And run the example:
```
bin/run-example.sh
```

For more details about the demo, please see the [README.md](examples/README.md) file in the [examples directory](examples/).

<a name="FAQ"></a>
## FAQ

* Where do I find the Spark logs?
  
 > Look for `$SPARK_HOME/work/app-XXX`. The last part of the address is the name of your application.
 
* Spark is too slow during start or H2O is not able to cluster.
  
 > Configure the Spark variable `SPARK_LOCAL_IP`. For example: 
  ```
  export SPARK_LOCAL_IP='127.0.0.1'
  ```  
* How do I increase the amount of memory assigned to the Spark executors in Sparkling Shell?
 
 > Sparkling Shell accepts common Spark Shell arguments. For example, to increase
 > the amount of memory allocated by each executor, use the `spark.executor.memory`
 > parameter: `bin/sparkling-shell --conf "spark.executor.memory=4g"`
